NAME
    CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make::PLExit - CPAN Test Dummy

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make::PLExit

DESCRIPTION
    This module has been developed with the single purpose of testing
    CPAN.pm itself.

    Contains no functionality, and will never do so. On the contrary, it
    exits during either "perl Makefile.PL" or "perl Build.PL" without
    creating a Makefile or Build file.
